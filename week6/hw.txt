1.if they observe all the bytes across the
network it still work. because what they see
it is the file we use private key to encode
if they dont have our public key to decode it
unless they have our public key to decode
then it will no be secure

(1) same if they dont have our public key
still dont know how to encode, so message still
secure
(2) if they have our private key and public key
by control our use booted our message will be
not secure.

2. command gpg --verify only if the public key and
private key are pair. we have to use third-party
create the certification to make sure everything
is good.
