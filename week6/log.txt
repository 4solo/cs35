first for both server and clinet
to install OpenSSH
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$sudo apt-get install openssh-client
For the Server
my partner is feng zhen
and I use
$sudo useradd -d /home/zhenge -m zhenge
to create the directory for him
$sudo passwd zhenge
this is going to set a password for him
then$cd /home/zhenge
$sudo mkdir .ssh
$sudo chown -R zhenge .ssh
$sudo chmod 700 .ssh
this is change the owner of ssh
and give him premission on .ssh directory
$ifconfig
to see the ip server for him

then for the Client side
$ssh-keygen
to create a key pair for the clinet
also create passphase for private key
$ping 10.85.97.201 to check if server responds
$ssh-copy-id -i yiwang@10.85.97.201
this ask for the password for server
and the passphase to use passwordless
$ssh-add
to make it passphaseless
$ssh -X yiwang@10.85.97.201
i dont need to enter password or passphase
once i log into the server
$xterm
to see if it worked an xterm window
$firebox
now i run the firebox on the server.
