1. download the file with wget
and $./configure CFLAGS="-g"
and $make
the error is there is two
same name function call futimens
then I download the patch use wget
and apply the patch
$patch -p0<coreutils.diff
and I make again
then I use emacs to debug
M-x gdb -i=mi ~/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls
and put a break point at sort_files
and run -lt $tmp
each time type s to go into next step
eventually I found out the function call
timespec_cmp inside timespec.h make the compare
I found out it may cause over flow becuase
if one is negative number and one is positive number
since we using subtraction it may cause over flow due
to one is large postive and large nagative.
so before the subtraction I make it to compare first
if b.tv_sec >a.tv_sec then return -1
if b.tv_sec >a.tv_sec then return 1
if they are the same return a.tv_nsec-b.tv_nsec.
if I make tmp inside the my home directory
because it is 32 bit and SEANET is 64 bit
then it will do the 0 extension there is
why 1918 become 2054.
