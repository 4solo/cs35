1)For the tr2b.c
I use stdio.h stdlib.h and string.h
first i count the length of two argv
if they are not the same output error
then
I put everything into an arr[128]
also a mark for this 128 number
if they are have duplicate bytes
I make it output error
if they dont have
I make first argv[1] as key in arr
map to value from argv[2]
then if they have match argv[1]
will replace by argv[2]
2)For the tr2u.c
almost the same thing
only thing need to change
putchar and getchar change to read and write
when we have error
we need to use write(2,errormessage,length of errormessage)
then I get a file contains at least 5,000,000bytes
then I use strace to compare tr2b and tr2u
I can see
3)a)read(0, "lR6LHt9Pv97YAcyWu4H2ryn0TPkVD00e"..., 65536) = 65536
write(1, "2jSLq18xbfXHh8pqDcQ385xb5vFe8a24"..., 65536) = 65536
which is copy from one file to another for tr2b
read(0, "P", 1)                         = 1
write(1, "P", 1)                        = 1
which is copy from one file to another for tr2u
b)
copy to my terminal
write(1, "ibXpVzJ2TU1poERKJlaHsVqyMYAurnew"..., 502ibXpVzJ2TU1

9telEI9cO4La9xCAnrrD3jLleAHNzEfaR3YjhYa4tlqlAj8oQhZ30ap) = 502
this is for tr2b
read(0, "f", 1)                         = 1
write(1, "f", 1f)                        = 1
this is for tr2u
4)$time ./tr2b a a <test.txt >testb.txt

real    0m0.175s
user    0m0.093s
sys     0m0.007s

this is for copy to file
$time ./tr2u a a <test.txt >testb.txt

real    0m5.319s
user    0m0.257s
sys     0m4.991s
copy to termial
$time ./tr2b a a <test.txt
real    0m1.003s
user    0m0.124s
sys     0m0.042s
$time ./tr2u a a <test.txt
real    0m6.173s
user    0m0.228s
sys     0m5.943s
As we can see
copy to file is much faster
also use tr2b is faster than tr2u
because we use buffer each time make system call
for every 65536 bytes
in each case output to termial is slower than
out put to file.
