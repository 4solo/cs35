1. write a helloworld program on C.
 $gcc hello.c -o hello.o
 $./hello.o
 output is hello,world!
2.$ldd hello.o
 linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff40361000)
 libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x0000003764000000)
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000003763c00000)
 this is my program use for dynamic libraries.
3.$strace ./hello.o
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
open("/lib64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY)      = 3
this is system call relate to dynamic linking.
$man ld.so
The programs ld.so and ld-linux.so* find and load the shared
libraries needed by a program, prepare the program to run, and then
run it.
$man libc
The term "libc" is commonly used as a shorthand for the "standard C library", a library of standard
functions that can be used by all C programs  (and  sometimes  by  programs  in  other  languages).
Because  of  some history (see below), use of the term "libc" to refer to the standard C library is
somewhat ambiguous on Linux.
4.$ls/usr/bin |awk'NR%101==504426290%101'
Awk NR gives you the total number of records being processed or line number.
which means only display the record when it%101 is same as my ID %101
5.my list is
apt no error
cameratopam no error
create_svnignore is not a dynamic executable
dehtmldiff is not a dynamic executable
eu-elfcmp no error
foomatic-datafile is not a dynamic executable
glxgears no error 
gpk-install-provide-file no error
hal-device no error
id no error
kadmin no error	
kmmatch no error
libpng-config is not a dynamic executable
man no error
msgunfmt no error
nspr-config is not a dynamic executable
pammixinterlace no error
pbmtoibm23xx no error
pgpring no error
pnmdepth no error
ppmtobmp  no error
qcatool2 no error
rftp is not a dynamic executable
scrollkeeper-get-toc-from-docpath is not a dynamic executable
smp_rep_phy_sata no error
systemsettings no error
uic3 no error
wrjpgcom no error
xsetroot no error
then I write a script to do the sort every dynamic library.
