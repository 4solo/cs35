Q1:The patch removed the "case_long_iso_time_style" because in line 2030
there is go to case_long_iso_time_style.
since this is only time it appear in the
code so we dont need to use this, so we delete this line
but even if we dont delete this line it still work.

Q2: the format for english is month day year but for other country is maybe
the day month year, also for the people who dont speak english
they may need to take time to find out what is the english means for the month
so using number is better and common way or depend on the locale.

Q3: because in choice which random lib
it return seq[int(self.random()*len(seq))]
raises IndexError if seq is empty
so since the file is no line inside, so the list is empty
and len(seq)=0 but return seq[0] which is the first line
but it doesn't exit

Q4:  File "./randline.py", line 43
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
this is only mistake. I think the python3 only can take one
argument.
if we change except IOError as err:
   errno,strerror =err.args
the problem solve
exceptions in Python 2 are iterable, and that you can iterate over
the parameters given to the exception by iterating over the except
ion itself.This of course breaks the "Explicit is better than impl
icit" rule of Python and has as such been removed in Python 3, so
you can no longer do that.
