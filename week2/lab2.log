then type wget http://www.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring15/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html >word1
this give the every char is not A-Za-z replace with \n which is change line
then I type tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html >word2
this command replace the input sequence repeated with only one \n
then I type tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html |sort >word3
this command sort the all the word in the word2 and put into word3
then I type tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html |sort -u >word4
this command make word in the word3 only appear one time
then I type tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u
| comm - words >word5
this command make compare two sorted file
one is from tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u
one is from words
and there is 3 column
first column is only  inside assign2.html like ALL
the second column is the word only inside words like 've
the last column is the words in both files like ASCII
then I type tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' <assign2.html | sort -u
| comm -23 words >word6
word6 only have one column which is only appear in the assign2.html
then I type wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm
