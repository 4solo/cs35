1. first get the clone
 $git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git
2.$git log >git-log.txt
3.$git tag >git-tags.txt
4.$git log
 type /maint:quote. to find out his number is 62ca21
5.$git checkout v3.0
6.$patch -p1<quote-patch.txt if it is not c file
 type enter and type y
7.it shows us what do we modified
 when we apply the patch to v3.0
8.9 then we use emacs to open the file is not .c file
 and use C-x v u to revert and for the c file have to
 check one by one use if is not a c.string we use C-c C-a
 the c file left is 6 files
 modified:   src/cmp.c
 modified:   src/diff.c
 modified:   src/diff3.c
 modified:   src/dir.c
 modified:   src/sdiff.c
 modified:   src/util.c
10. use emacs to open the src/diff.c.rej and src/diff3.c.rej
 then we need to use emacs open src/diff.c and src/diff3.c to
 change different
11. need to use git clean -f to remove the all untracked file
12. $git diff>quote-3.0-patch.txt  
13. type ./bootstrap
 ./configure
 make
 make check
14. diff . - diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
 ./diff . - give us same output
 and download the source code and compare to the latter one
 use src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0
 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
15. then use diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt
 they outout something. they are not the same
 but it is not innocuous. because the order is different.
